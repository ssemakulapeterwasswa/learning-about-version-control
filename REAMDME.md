What I like most about version control is how it allows me to track every change I make, collaborate easily with others, and experiment freely without fear of losing progress. It makes me feel more confident and organized as a machine learning engineer.

What I find most challenging about version control is dealing with merge conflicts and understanding how different branches interact. Sometimes it can feel confusing or frustrating, but with practice, I know it will become easier.
